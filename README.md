**Date: 21-04-2024**

**Dataset Overview:**

- Total number of texts/documents analyzed: 54

**Sentiment Distribution:**

- Positive Sentiments: 72.22%
- Negative Sentiments: 12.96%
- Neutral Sentiments: 14.81%


**Sentiment Analysis Examples:**

1. **Positive Sentiments:**
   - With resilience and a positive mindset, I embrace setbacks as opportunities for growth and learning.
   - Yes, I thrive on exploring the unfamiliar and broadening my horizons.

   - Disappointment is like a dark cloud, covering the sun of my expectations.

3. **Neutral Sentiments:**
   - Bad news can be upsetting, but it's important to remember that it can also be an opportunity for growth and learning.
   - Forgiveness is not forgetting, but it is choosing to let go of the hurt and anger that binds us.
   - With a mixture of excitement, curiosity, and perhaps a hint of anxiety.

**Key Findings:**
- According to the model's predictions, approximately `72%` of sentiments are positive
- neutral and negative sentiments account for roughly `14.8%` and `13%` respectively.



**Recommendations:**

- Due to the small dataset size and the tendency of the LLM model to generate positive sentiment statements for various questions, it's crucial to enhance result accuracy.
- Implement fine-tuning of a classification model using our dataset to address this challenge effectively.
- Fine-tuning the model can significantly improve accuracy, leading to more reliable outcomes.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, the analysis underscores the importance of addressing the limitations posed by the small dataset and the predisposition of the LLM model towards positive sentiment responses. By leveraging fine-tuning techniques with a classification model, there exists a promising avenue to substantially enhance result accuracy. This proactive approach not only mitigates potential biases but also ensures more dependable and precise outcomes in sentiment analysis tasks.
